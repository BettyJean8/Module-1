# 1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
The data suggests that certain categories, such as "Plays" and "Music," tend to have higher success rates for crowdfunding campaigns, indicating they resonate more with backers compared to categories like "Games" or "Technology." Regardless campaign failures are common across all categories, showing that success is not guaranteed. Also, the number of canceled campaigns is relatively low compared to both successful and failed campaigns suggesting that most campaigns tend to run their course once launched, regardless of their outcome.

# 2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?
Here are some possible limitations with the data. First, it doesn't provide information about the amount of funding or how close failed campaigns came to reaching their goals, which could offer more context on the degree of failure. Second, there’s no data on the length of time campaigns were active, which could be a key factor in determining success. Lastly, the dataset lacks demographic details, which could influence campaign outcomes and offer more insight into patterns of success or failure across different regions, genders or groups.
